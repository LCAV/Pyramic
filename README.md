Pyramic: An FPGA based compact microphone array
=========================

This repository contains the design files and the documentation for the Pyramic compact microphone array.
Pyramic has 48 microphones spread on 6 PCBs, each bearing 8 MEMS microphones and an ADC. This allows for
flexible geometries while keeping calibration simple. The array plugs in a DE1-SoC FPGA that collects
the data from the 6 ADC and can do real-time processing of the signals with output to an audio codec.
Alternatively, the data can be sent to an ARM CPU that is on the same chip for further processing.

Dependencies
------------

* The PCB were designed in Altium.
* The FPGA cores were developed using Altera's tools (the free web edition should be sufficient).

From Zero to Pyramic Compilation
--------------------------------

(on Ubuntu linux)

The FPGA part

1. Follow `fpga/README.md` to install the Altera SoC EDS and Quartus Lite
2. Open Quartus
    
    nios_command_shell
    quartus &

3. Open Pyramic project: `File -> Open Project...` and select `hw/quartus/Pyramic_Array.qpf`
4. Open Qsys via Quartus by `Tools -> Qsys`
5. In Qsys, generate the HDL files `Generate -> Generate HDL...` and click `Generate`
6. Back in Quartus, compile by `Processing -> Start Compilation`
7. Generate the hardware header

    cd fpga/MIC_ARRAY
    ./create_hw_headers.sh

8. Generate `RBF` file

    quartus_cpf -c hw/quartus/output_files/Pyramic_Array.sof socfpga.rbf

  and place it at the root of the SD card

Hopefully, things went smoothly. Now we can try to compile the library that let us
control Pyramic from HPS.

1. For the compilation, some additional C library is required

    sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386
    sudo apt-get install zlib1g:i386

2. Start the embedded development shell

    embedded_command_shell

3. Compile `libpyramicio`

    cd fpga/MIC_ARRAY/sw/hps/application/pyramicio
    make all

4. The files `pyramic.h` and `libpyramicio.so` can be copied to the system on the DE1-SoC
