/** A library that allows an easy access to the Pyramic array.
 * This library is compiled using headers derived from the VHDL code available
 * at: http://github.com/lcav/pyramic.git.
 * In order to compile this library, one has to run the "headers_rbf.sh" file
 * that can be found in the toplevel MIC_ARRAY directory to provide the Quartus
 * generated header files.
 *
 * The pyramicio.h file gives access to the API provided by libpyramicio.
 * It enables the use of a Pyramic array with an abstraction layer that removes
 * the hassle of the FPGA addresses. This enables programming applications that
 * use the Pyramic array against an existing design without using the Quartus
 * Prime tools.
