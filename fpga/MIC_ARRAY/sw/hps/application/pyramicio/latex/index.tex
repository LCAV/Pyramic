\hypertarget{index_Wh}{}\section{What is libpyramicio ?}\label{index_Wh}
This library is an abstraction layer for the Pyramic array -\/made at L\+C\+AV (E\+P\+FL)-\/ input/output functions. It enables the use of the Pyramic array by designing software against an existing hardware design without having to use Altera Quartus Prime tools, or recompiling the application at each change of the design in V\+H\+DL.\hypertarget{index_Hw}{}\section{How to use it ?}\label{index_Hw}
In order to use the library, one just has to include the $<$\hyperlink{pyramicio_8h}{pyramicio.\+h}$>$ file, then initialize a Pyramic object through the \hyperlink{pyramicio_8h_ac3c433fb9ac54d8e5e93a2423ed79e5e}{pyramic\+Initialize\+Pyramic()} function.

All the usable functions are documented in the \hyperlink{pyramicio_8h}{pyramicio.\+h} file reference in this documentation.

Note that programs that use the Pyramic have to be run as root, because the library is using direct references to memory areas that are reserved for the system.
